# Contributing

We love contributions! and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.

**Impostor syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

## What Can I Do?

* Tackle any [issues](https://github.com/ELSPL/RoboticsStudyGroup/issues) you wish! We have a special
  label for issues that beginners might want to try. Have a look at our
  [current beginner issues.](https://github.com/ELSPL/RoboticsStudyGroup/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astarter)
  Also have a look at if the issue is already assigned to someone - this helps us make sure
  that work is not duplicated if the issue is already being worked on by members. If its assigned it will have label "Status: In Progress"
* Contribute code you already have. It does not need to be perfect! We will help you clean
  things up, test it, etc.
* Make a tutorial or example of how to do something.
* Improve documentation of a feature you found troublesome. You can add tutorials, books or any helpful resources you found necessary while working in this community. 
* File a new issue if you run into problems!

Usage question in the issue tracker will probably go unanswered.

## Reporting issues

When reporting issues please include as much detail as possible.
Whenever possible, please also include a [short, self-contained code example](http://sscce.org) that demonstrates the problem.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:${user}/RoboticsStudyGroup.git
    cd RoboticsStudyGroup
    ```
  3. Create a branch for your changes
    ```
    git checkout -b name-of-your-branch
